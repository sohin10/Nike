# Project-2---NIKE 

# Milestone 1

I've always been an admirer of animation and 3D designs, and I'm attracted to websites with intriguing and engaging interactivity. I believe it is a great approach to keep people interested while also creatively presenting what the website requires or wants the users to achieve and understand. 

I initially used javascript(p5js) to make generative art, patterns, and visualizations last year while taking Justin's Creative Coding course. This course motivated me to explore the realm of creative coding and construct aesthetically beautiful, dynamic, and living website designs. 

During that course, I discovered Three JS and briefly read about it, but I never had the opportunity to go more into it and explore it. To create an interactive landing page, I want to learn and explore the various JS libraries, notably THREE.js, for my Project 2 assignment. I've been reading about the numerous JS libraries and how each of them has very unique characteristics but could potentially be combined to make a very dynamic website. 

### DESIGN IDEA 
Initially, I was considering building upon my Project 1 by generating a 3D model of the product (an ordinary skincare bottle) and enhancing the interactivity of my existing product detail page with a 3D model using THREE.js. 

However, I wanted to develop an entirely new aesthetic and design for this project in order to provide myself with a challenge and to depart from my regular visual approach. 

I want to develop the primary design using THREE.js, but I may also investigate PIXI.js to provide a complementary interactive backdrop if possible. 

Spline.design is a website that enables you to build 3D models in the same manner as Blender or Maya. If feasible, I would also want to learn this new technology to construct my 3D model. 



### PROJECT 2 Design 
For this project, I want to utilize the Particle system in THREE.js, construct a 3D object in Spline, then import it into my code so that it can rotate, zoom, and perhaps be deformed using the mouse. The scene will also have text. 



### PROTOTYPE 
As of now, I have a general concept of how my prototype's design would appear, but this may change as I begin coding and learn more about THREE.js and WEBGL. 

To develop my prototype, I made a hand-drawn drawing on an iPad. Drawing my ideas on paper first assists me to get my creative juices flowing and gives me with a clear outline of what I am attempting to create and what I want to accomplish. 





In conclusion, I look forward to learning this new JS tool and becoming more imaginative in order to construct an interactive website that maintains the user's interest. This project has the potential to be the kind of work I want to be able to undertake as a Front End Developer and is a solid foundation for me to develop upon.






# Milestone 2

I've been reading the documentation and watching YouTube tutorials to figure out how THREE JS works. It is a large library to learn from, and it might be frightening since there is so much you can do and so many different methods to accomplish it. 

The particle system in Three js is what piqued my interest. I noticed a few tutorials where the object or 3D structure displayed by the particle system could be altered using three js and mouse controls. 


I was inspired by a website, snp.agency, I saw online while looking for inpiration. Their landing page features a cool interactive 3d model that sits behind some text and moves when you hover over it with your mouse.


### Design & Prototype
I was thinking of portfolio pieces so that I can add this to my portfolio hence, I want to yet again work on making a cool ecommerce website. Nike is such an amazing brand and their aesthetics are very intriguing to me. They are abstract and always have some sort of interactivity within their websites.

Thus for my design I was thinking of creating a landing page for a Nike shoe. The Nike Shoe would be the 3d model I will be designing in spline(still learning this tool). 
The shoe on the landing page would be made into a particle system using a three js particle system and it would move as you hover over it or zoom in and out. If possible I may add some light effects to it as well to make it pop more.

There will be a button that will take you then into that product(the shoe) detail page. Here that same 3D model of the show would be in color and solids instead of the particles.

Below is a sketch of the pages I wish to build.

# Milestone 2 - CHANGES


As I began working with and learning THREE JS, I discovered that my project idea with the particle system was too complex for me to accomplish in such a short period of time. 

I began using spline and figuring out how to make and import 3D models into the program. The program features an integrated method for generating JS code for you. It included a whole THREE Js file formatted to be used in my project. It was perfect, but I chose not to utilize it. This was due to the fact that it was already pre-written, and if I used it as-is, I would not learn anything about THREE JS (and my goal is to get a better understanding of THREE JS and be able to use and manipulate it as I want). 

As a result, I decided to modify my initial idea for the animation I intended to produce for this project. 

This project's initial concept remains unchanged; it is still an ecommerce website for NIKE. However, this is more akin to a soft launch for a new product. 
I desired for the 3D model to animate and float while scrolling. 


I created a new prototype design and began to replicate it in code. 
As my professor Peter said, THREE JS is a lot, and it is. I am pleased with how my website turned out since it is almost identical to how I envisioned it. 

I am now working on some difficulties with the website since the orbit controls function doesn't work correctly in desktop view, but kind of works in mobile view if the scroll is not engaged. I suspect it has something to do with the scroll interfering with the orbit controls and maybe the size of my 3D model and the canvas area it occupies. 

Overall, I believe the project functions well and looks neat. I learnt and played with the camera, the various lighting, the rotations, and the placement of the 3D model. It was exciting and incredibly fascinating to watch how the 3D model moved around, and it is such a fantastic way to develop websites and add life and interactivity to websites. 

Once I am more familiar with THREE JS, I want to revisit this project and create a 
particle-based 3D model of the shoe, which solidifies when it is explored.

## New Protoype

Below is the sketch showcasing the new prototpye.

# MILESTONE 4 

I believe I enjoyed designing this website the most. I took on the challenge of working with a new toolkit for my second project. As previously stated, I chose THREE.js for this project because I am fascinated by animations and adore how they can breathe life into a static website design and make it engaging and interactive. 

Before beginning this project and coding, I explored the THREE.js documentation to familiarize myself with the many techniques and choices three js has to offer. Once I had a general notion, I began watching YouTube tutorials to have a deeper knowledge of how the code functions and appears while it is live. 
It was fascinating to see how three.js allowed you to import many object files from different softwares into your website. 


Then I began sketching my website layout on my iPad. I was developing a Nike e-commerce website for this project. I desired to design a website based on Nike's aesthetics and in line with its brand identification. However, I aimed to make the website feel alive and interactive. 

My initial plan was to employ the particle system of Three.js to turn an obj file of a 3D shoe into particles, which, upon further exploration and movement, would reform into the shoe's solid shape. 

However, as I began to code it, I encountered numerous issues and errors, and it seems tough to learn such complicated code in such a short period. 

Consequently, I modified my first design and somewhat deviated. The website's overall design remained unchanged, however I altered the animations. 

In addition to learning Three.js, I studied gsap, which aided in the animation of my 3D model and screens. 

My final design was a soft launch of a new nike jordans sneaker, and you could move it, zoom in and out, and basically get a 360-degree view of the shoe using the mouse in order to purchase it. 

The code is currently a bit flawed, as the shoe does not move in desktop mode. However, if you switch to mobile view, you can observe the orbit control function of Three.js in action, which I thought was a really cool tool to apply on this website. 

### # Milestone 2 - CHANGES
I added an additional milestone 2 with changes I made to my design so that I could also document those changes as I changed my original plan before preseniting it.
You can read about those under this heading.

I received positive responses from everyone regarding the aesthetics and color scheme of my website. This will be added to my personal portfolio. 
During the winter break, I plan to delve deeper into understanding THREE.js and gaining a firm grip of its fundamentals, as well as developing more amazing website designs for my portfolio. When I become an "expert Three.js programmer", I will work on resolving this project's issues and possibly develop the particle system. 

Overall, it was a very enjoyable project to work on and to see how others implemented other libraries, as well as to learn so much more about other libraries, which I look forward to learning more about and utilizing in future projects and works.
